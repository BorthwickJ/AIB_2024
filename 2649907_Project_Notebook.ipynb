Access to the journal can be achieved by going to the special collections section of the University of Glasgow website, where meetings can be arranged to see the journal in person. Currently, there is no digitised version of the travel journal available."

    "\n",
    "Travel in the 19th century differs greatly to travel nowadays.  In the late 19th century, the main form of travel was by lakes, rivers, and oceans. Roads were very different to what they are now as it was mainly horses that went on them, as cars weren’t invented until the later 19th century, after the timeframe of the travel journal. My video gives insight to these differences in travel. \n"

    "### What is my project?\n",
    "For my project I decided upon a video, using both AI and human creativity.  For the main video, I used a software named Kaiber.AI. This software allows the user to upload images and prompts, to either generate a new image or animate an image. After using the software, I edited the individual clips together myself, reinforcing the connection between AI and human creativity. The reasoning for choosing this software was because it allowed me to show how AI can be positively used to enhance older writings. By using software’s like Kaiber.AI it allows for older writings to be more easily interacted with. Creating videos, images, and sounds allows for a wider range of audience to interact and see important older documents. "

    "# Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially, I looked at the journal in person via the special collections at University of Glasgow. After reading the transcript of the journal and looking at the images and pictures present within it, I then decided upon my method of digitisation. At first, taking images of the pages was my preferred method, however after discussion with peers I decided upon using [Adobes scanner app](https://www.adobe.com/uk/acrobat/mobile/scanner-app.html#:~:text=Adobe%20Scan%20uses%20AI%20to,editable%2C%20searchable%20PDF%20files%20instantly.) which scanned the page and created a digital PDF of each page. Not only was this a higher quality than taking direct pictures of the page, but also made it much easier when interacting with generative AI models due to the digitised versions being clearer. "

    "However, a few of the images that were generated I wasn’t sufficiently happy with. I tried numerous different prompts and methods, but some of the animations still appeared “messy” and perhaps did not enhance the original image as planned. This is due to the software used still being in the beta stage and may be because the free version was used and not the paid premium. The text to speech AI used worked as expected and displayed correct results. For further development of my project, I would try and fix the animations that are not as good as the others."
